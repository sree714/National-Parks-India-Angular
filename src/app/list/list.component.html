            </div>Besides Africa, Gir National Park in Gujarat is the only place in the world where you can spot lions
            roaming free in the wild. The real discovery channel of India is situated approximately 65 Kms South East of
            Junagarh District. The Government notified the large geographical extent of Sasan Gir as wildlife sanctuary
            on 18th September, 1965 in order to conserve the Asiatic Lion. It covers total area of 1412 square
            kilometers of which 258 Km forms the core area of the National Park. Indiscriminate hunting by the people of
            Junagarh led to their decrease in population drastically, while they were completely wiped out from the
            other parts of Asia. It was the kind effort of Nawabs of Junagarh who protected the queen royalty in his own
            private hunting grounds. Later in due course of time Department of Forest Officials came forward to protect
            the worldâ€™s most threatened species. From a population of approximately 20 lions in 1913, they have risen to
            a comfortable 523 according to 2015 census. There are 106 male, 201 female and 213 sub-adult lions in the
            wilderness of these four districts.

            <p class="mb-1">Bandhavgarh National Park is a national park of India, located in the Umaria district of

              park in 1968 and then became Tiger Reserve in 1993. The current core area is spread over 716 square
              kilometres (276 sq mi).
              This park has a large biodiversity. The park has a large breeding population of leopards, and various
              species of deer. Maharaja Martand Singh of Rewa captured the first white tiger in this region in 1951.
              This white tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharajas of Rewa.
              Historically villagers and their cattle have been at a threat from the tiger. Rising mining activities
              around the park are putting the tigers at risk. The Park derived its name from the most prominent hill of
              the area which is said to have been given by Lord Rama to his brother Laxman to keep a watch on Lanka.</p>
